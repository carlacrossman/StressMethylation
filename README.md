### This is a repository for the project looking at:

# Epigenetic Manifestations of Stress in Resident Killer Whales 


#### The repository contains the following:  

- **ReadBam_to_Methylation.R**  This is the code to generate the percent methylation at each CpG site from the .bam files.
- **orcaData.csv**  This is the data file containing percent methylation for each CpG site for each individual. This data file contains more sites and loci than used in this study, but there are a few lines of code at the beginning of the model file that extract what is needed.
- **Methylation_model_4_loci.R**  This is the code to run the Bayesian model, generate/save the posteriors and evaulate the model performance.
- **Orca_plots.R**  This is the code to generate the figures presented in the paper. It requires the data file and the posteriors file generated by the model.
